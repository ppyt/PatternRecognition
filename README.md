Under this repository, I will introduce some traditional algotithms learned from the pattern recognition course,which is taught  by Professor Zhang. The overview is given as follows:

#### Pattern Recognition
+ Unsupervised
    + Principal Component Analysis 
    + Isometric Feature Mapping
    + Multidimensional scaling
	+ and so on 
+ Supervised
    + Support Vector Machine
    + Decision Tree
    + Adaptive Boosting
    + and so on 

I will introduce every algorithm and its variants above.
